# Tank Royal Web UI

This is an extremely simple web ui to show games from [tank-royal](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale). 

As implemented, it just watches localhost and moves things around very crudely. Currently supports bots w/ movement and bullets.

How da heck do svg graphics work?! I shall learn through this repo.
